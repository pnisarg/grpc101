/*
This file defines what can be said between server and client.

It allows you to define two things "service" and "message".
A service is a collection of actions the server can perform at the clientâ€™s request.
A message is the content of this request.
To simplify, you can say that service defines actions, while message defines objects.

/*
This file cannot be used as is. It needs to get compiled. 
Compiling the proto file means generating code for your chosen language, that your application will actually call.

Compiling proto files:

Change directory where your *.proto files are, and run the following command.
$protoc -I. -I$GOPATH/src --go_out=plugins=grpc:. api.proto

Running this command should have generated `api.pb.go` file automatically. This is what will be used in our code.
